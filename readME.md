# The Sound of Success: An Analysis of Billboard Top 100 Trends (1958-2025) #

## Haiden Hunter, Ryan Armendariz-Lopez ##

Our research question: what musical characteristics are most strongly associated with chart success on the Billboard Top 100, and how have these features evolved over time? Drawing on publicly available datasets from Billboard, Spotify, and Genius, we plan to merge chart rankings with quantitative audio features such as tempo, energy, key, and danceability.

This research topic interests us because we’re both independent music producers trying to make our way in an industry that can feel impossible to break into without a major label or massive marketing budget. We’ve always wondered what really separates songs that make it onto the Billboard charts from those that don’t. By analyzing data on popular songs, we hope to understand what kinds of musical and lyrical features tend to connect with audiences. Our goal isn’t to copy trends, but to use data to make smarter creative choices and help other indie artists do the same. 

This project is useful because it transforms subjective ideas about “what makes a hit” into interpretable insights. Music producers, songwriters, and marketers could use the findings to identify shifting stylistic trends, benchmark new releases against historical patterns, or anticipate emerging sounds likely to resonate with audiences.

The analytical plan includes data collection and cleaning, exploratory trend analysis, and building models to examine relationships between musical features and chart performance. Linear regression and k-mean clustering could be employed to identify dominant feature combinations among top-performing songs, while time-series analysis could reveal how these patterns change across years.

Ultimately, it would be great to have both a predictive tool to identify where a song might end up on the charts based on its quantitative audio features, as well as general analysis of chart history to predict what trends might be on the rise.
